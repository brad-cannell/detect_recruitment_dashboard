# Overview

Using this file to do some quick checks I'm interested in. Eventually, I need to add some of this to the dashboard.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

# Load data

Get on VPN first.

```{r}
source("data_import.R")
```

How many F/U's scheduled between 2020-06-15 and 2020-07-15

```{r}
scheduled_ids %>% 
  filter(scheduled_date >= "2020-06-15" & scheduled_date < "2020-07-15")
```

It looks like we scheduled 28 F/U interviews.

How many were scheduled in the month before COVID?

```{r}
scheduled_ids %>% 
  filter(scheduled_date >= "2020-02-15" & scheduled_date < "2020-03-15")
```

How many LEAD panels done? How many positive?

Look at Qualtrics data

```{r}
lead_qual <- read_csv("/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/DETECT+Lead+Panel+Assessment_July+16,+2020_08.52.csv")
```
